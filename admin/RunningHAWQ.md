This section provides information for system administrators and database superusers responsible for administering a HAWQ system.

This guide provides information and instructions for configuring, maintaining and using a HAWQ system. This guide is intended for system and database administrators responsible for managing a HAWQ system.

This guide assumes knowledge of Linux/UNIX system administration, database management systems, database administration, and structured query language \(SQL\). Because HAWQ is based on PostgreSQL 8.2.15, this guide assumes some familiarity with PostgreSQL. This guide calls out similarities between HAWQ and PostgreSQL features throughout.
