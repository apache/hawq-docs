Removes a database role.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
dropuser [connection_option ...] [-e] [-i] role_name

dropuser --help 

dropuser --version
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`dropuser` removes an existing role from HAWQ. Only superusers and users with the `CREATEROLE` privilege can remove roles. To remove a superuser role, you must yourself be a superuser.

`dropuser` is a wrapper around the SQL command `DROP         ROLE`.

## Options<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

*role\_name*  
The name of the role to be removed. You will be prompted for a name if not specified on the command line.

-e | --echo  
Echo the commands that `dropuser` generates and sends to the server.

-i | --interactive  
Prompt for confirmation before actually removing the role.

**Connection Options**
-h *host* | --host *host*  
The host name of the machine on which the HAWQ master database server is running. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGHOST` or defaults to localhost.

-p *port* | --port *port*  
The TCP port on which the HAWQ master database server is listening for connections. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGPORT` or defaults to 5432.

-U *username* | --username *username*  
The database role name to connect as. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGUSER` or defaults to the current system role name.

-w | --no-password  
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a `.pgpass` file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password.

-W | --password  
Force a password prompt.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

To remove the role `joe` using default connection options:

``` pre
dropuser joe
```

To remove the role *joe* using connection options, with verification, and a peek at the underlying command:

``` pre
dropuser -p 54321 -h masterhost -i -e joe
Role "joe" will be permanently removed.
Are you sure? (y/n) y
DROP ROLE "joe"
```
