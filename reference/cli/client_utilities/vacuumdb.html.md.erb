## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`vacuumdb` is a utility for cleaning a PostgreSQL database. vacuumdb will also generate internal statistics used by the PostgreSQL query optimizer.

`vacuumdb` is a wrapper around the SQL command `VACUUM`. There is no effective difference between vacuuming databases via this utility and via other methods for accessing the server.

## Options<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

-a | --all  
Vacuums all databases.

\[-d\] *dbname* | \[--dbname\] *dbname*  
The name of the database to vacuum. If this is not specified and `-all` is not used, the database name is read from the environment variable `PGDATABASE`. If that is not set, the user name specified for the connection is used.

-f | --full  
Selects a full vacuum, which may reclaim more space, but takes much longer and exclusively locks the table.

**Warning:** A `VACUUM FULL` is not recommended in HAWQ.

-F | --freeze  
Freeze row transaction information.

-q | --quiet  
Do not display a response.

-t *table* \[(*column*)\] | --table *table* \[(*column*)\]  
Clean or analyze this table only. Column names may be specified only in conjunction with the `--analyze` option. If you specify columns, you probably have to escape the parentheses from the shell.

-v | --verbose  
Print detailed information during processing.

-z | --analyze  
Collect statistics for use by the query planner.

**Connection Options**  
-h *host* | --host *host*  
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the HAWQ master database server is running. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGHOST` or defaults to localhost.

-p *port* | --port *port*  
Specifies the TCP port on which the HAWQ master database server is listening for connections. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGPORT` or defaults to 5432.

-U *username* | --username *username*  
The database role name to connect as. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGUSER` or defaults to the current system user name.

-w | --no-password  
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a `.pgpass` file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password.

-W | --password  
Force a password prompt.

## Notes<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

`vacuumdb` might need to connect several times to the master server, asking for a password each time. It is convenient to have a `~/.pgpass` file in such cases.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section7"></a>

To clean the database `test`:

``` pre
vacuumdb test
```

To clean and analyze a database named `bigdb`:

``` pre
vacuumdb --analyze bigdb
```

To clean a single table `foo` in a database named `mydb`, and analyze a single column `bar` of the table. Note the quotes around the table and column names to escape the parentheses from the shell:

``` pre
vacuumdb --analyze --verbose --table 'foo(bar)' mydb
```
