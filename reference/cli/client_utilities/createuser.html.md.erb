Creates a new database role.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
createuser [connection_option ...] [role_attribute ...] [-e] role_name

createuser --help 

createuser --version
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`createuser` creates a new HAWQ role. You must be a superuser or have the `CREATEROLE` privilege to create new roles. You must connect to the database as a superuser to create new superusers.

Superusers can bypass all access permission checks within the database, so superuser privileges should not be granted lightly.

`createuser` is a wrapper around the SQL command `CREATE ROLE`.

## Options<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

role\_name  
The name of the role to be created. This name must be different from all existing roles in this HAWQ installation.

-c *number* | -\\\-connection-limit *number*  
Set a maximum number of connections for the new role. The default is to set no limit.

-D | -\\\-no-createdb  
The new role will not be allowed to create databases. This is the default.

-d | -\\\-createdb  
The new role will be allowed to create databases.

-e | -\\\-echo  
Echo the commands that `createuser` generates and sends to the server.

-E | -\\\-encrypted  
Encrypts the role's password stored in the database. If not specified, the default password behavior is used.

-i | -\\\-inherit  
The new role will automatically inherit privileges of roles it is a member of. This is the default.

-I | -\\\-no-inherit  
The new role will not automatically inherit privileges of roles it is a member of.

-l | -\\\-login  
The new role will be allowed to log in to HAWQ. This is the default.

-L | -\\\-no-login  
The new role will not be allowed to log in (a group-level role).

-N | -\\\-unencrypted  
Does not encrypt the role's password stored in the database. If not specified, the default password behavior is used.

-P | -\\\-pwprompt  
If given, `createuser` will issue a prompt for the password of the new role. This is not necessary if you do not plan on using password authentication.

-r | -\\\-createrole  
The new role will be allowed to create new roles (`CREATEROLE` privilege).

-R | -\\\-no-createrole  
The new role will not be allowed to create new roles. This is the default.

-s | -\\\-superuser  
The new role will be a superuser.

-S | -\\\-no-superuser  
The new role will not be a superuser. This is the default.

**Connection Options**

-h *host* | -\\\-host *host*  
The host name of the machine on which the HAWQ master database server is running. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGHOST` or defaults to localhost.

-p *port* | -\\\-port *port*  
The TCP port on which the HAWQ master database server is listening for connections. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGPORT` or defaults to 5432.

-U *username* | -\\\-username *username*  
The database role name to connect as. If not specified, reads from the environment variable `PGUSER` or defaults to the current system role name.

-w | -\\\-no-password  
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a `.pgpass` file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password.

-W | -\\\-password  
Force a password prompt.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

Create a role named `joe` using the default options:

``` shell
$ createuser joe
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
CREATE ROLE
```

To create the same role `joe` using connection options and avoiding the prompts and taking a look at the underlying command:

``` shell
$ createuser -h masterhost -p 54321 -S -D -R -e joe
CREATE ROLE joe NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE INHERIT 
LOGIN;
CREATE ROLE
```

To create the role `joe` as a superuser, and assign password `admin123` immediately:

``` shell
$ createuser -P -s -e joe
Enter password for new role: admin123
Enter it again: admin123
CREATE ROLE joe PASSWORD 'admin123' SUPERUSER CREATEDB 
CREATEROLE INHERIT LOGIN;
CREATE ROLE
```

In the above example, the new password is not actually echoed when typed, but we show what was typed for clarity. However the password will appear in the echoed command, as illustrated if the `-e` option is used.
