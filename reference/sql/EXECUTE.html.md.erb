title: EXECUTE
---

Executes a prepared SQL statement.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
EXECUTE name [ (parameter [, ...] ) ]
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`EXECUTE` is used to execute a previously prepared statement. Since prepared statements only exist for the duration of a session, the prepared statement must have been created by a `PREPARE` statement executed earlier in the current session.

If the `PREPARE` statement that created the statement specified some parameters, a compatible set of parameters must be passed to the `EXECUTE` statement, or else an error is raised. Note that (unlike functions) prepared statements are not overloaded based on the type or number of their parameters; the name of a prepared statement must be unique within a database session.

For more information on the creation and usage of prepared statements, see `PREPARE`.

## Parameters<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

 *name*   
The name of the prepared statement to execute.

 *parameter*   
The actual value of a parameter to the prepared statement. This must be an expression yielding a value that is compatible with the data type of this parameter, as was determined when the prepared statement was created.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section5"></a>

Create a prepared statement for an `INSERT` statement, and then execute it:

``` pre
PREPARE fooplan (int, text, bool, numeric) AS INSERT INTO 
foo VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);
EXECUTE fooplan(1, 'Hunter Valley', 't', 200.00);
```

## Compatibility<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

The SQL standard includes an `EXECUTE` statement, but it is only for use in embedded SQL. This version of the `EXECUTE` statement also uses a somewhat different syntax.
