title: ALTER OPERATOR CLASS
---

Changes the definition of an operator class.

## <a id="synop"></a>Synopsis

``` sql
ALTER OPERATOR CLASS name USING index_method RENAME TO newname

ALTER OPERATOR CLASS name USING index_method OWNER TO newowner
```

## <a id="desc"></a>Description

`ALTER OPERATOR CLASS` changes the definition of an operator class. 

You must own the operator class to use `ALTER OPERATOR CLASS`. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the operator class’s schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner does not do anything you could not do by dropping and recreating the operator class. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any operator class anyway.)
