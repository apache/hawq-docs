title: ALTER OPERATOR
---

Changes the definition of an operator.

## <a id="synop"></a>Synopsis

```pre
ALTER OPERATOR name ( {lefttype | NONE} , {righttype | NONE} ) 
   OWNER TO newowner        
```

## <a id="desc"></a>Description

`ALTER OPERATOR` changes the definition of an operator. The only currently available functionality is to change the owner of the operator. 

You must own the operator to use `ALTER OPERATOR`. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the operator’s schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner does not do anything you could not do by dropping and recreating the operator. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any operator anyway.)

## <a id="alteroperator__section4"></a>Parameters

 *name*   
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator.

 *lefttype*   
The data type of the operator's left operand; write `NONE` if the operator has no left operand.

 *righttype*   
The data type of the operator's right operand; write `NONE` if the operator has no right operand.

 *newowner*   
The new owner of the operator.

## <a id="example"></a>Example

Change the owner of a custom operator `a @@ b` for type `text`:

```pre
ALTER OPERATOR @@ (text, text) OWNER TO joe;
```

## <a id="compat"></a>Compatibility

There is no `ALTER OPERATOR` statement in the SQL standard.
