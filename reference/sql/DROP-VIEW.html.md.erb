title: DROP VIEW

Removes a view.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] name [, ...] [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`DROP VIEW` will remove an existing view. Only the owner of a view can remove it.

## Parameters<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

IF EXISTS  
Do not throw an error if the view does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

 *name*   
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the view to remove.

CASCADE  
Automatically drop objects that depend on the view (such as other views).

RESTRICT  
Refuse to drop the view if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section5"></a>

Remove the view `topten`;

``` pre
DROP VIEW topten;
```

## Compatibility<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

`DROP VIEW` is fully conforming with the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one view to be dropped per command. Also, the `IF           EXISTS` option is a HAWQ extension.
