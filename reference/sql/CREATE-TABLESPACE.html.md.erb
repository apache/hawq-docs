title: CREATE TABLESPACE
---

Defines a new tablespace.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
CREATE TABLESPACE tablespace_name [OWNER username]
       FILESPACE filespace_name
         
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`CREATE TABLESPACE` registers a new tablespace for your HAWQ system. The tablespace name must be distinct from the name of any existing tablespace in the system.

A tablespace allows superusers to define an alternative location on the file system where the data files containing database objects (such as tables) may reside.

A user with appropriate privileges can pass a tablespace name to /3/4 or /3/4 to have the data files for these objects stored within the specified tablespace.

In HAWQ, there must be a file system location defined for the master and each segment in order for the tablespace to have a location to store its objects across an entire HAWQ system. This collection of file system locations is defined in a filespace object. A filespace must be defined before you can create a tablespace. See /3/4 for more information.

## Parameters<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

 *tablespacename*   
The name of a tablespace to be created. The name cannot begin with `pg_`, as such names are reserved for system tablespaces.

OWNER *username*   
The name of the user who will own the tablespace. If omitted, defaults to the user executing the command. Only superusers may create tablespaces, but they can assign ownership of tablespaces to non-superusers.

FILESPACE *filespace\_name*   
The name of a HAWQ filespace that was defined using the `hawq filespace` management utility.

## Notes<a id="topic1__section5"></a>

You must first create a filespace to be used by the tablespace. See /3/4 for more information.

Tablespaces are only supported on systems that support symbolic links.

`CREATE TABLESPACE` cannot be executed inside a transaction block.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

Create a new tablespace by specifying the corresponding filespace to use:

``` pre
CREATE TABLESPACE mytblspace FILESPACE myfilespace;
```

## Compatibility<a id="topic1__section7"></a>

`CREATE TABLESPACE` is a HAWQ extension.
