title: REASSIGN OWNED
---

Changes the ownership of database objects owned by a database role.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
REASSIGN OWNED BY old_role [, ...] TO new_role
         
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`REASSIGN OWNED` reassigns all the objects in the current database that are owned by *old\_row* to *new\_role*. Note that it does not change the ownership of the database itself.

## Parameters<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

 *old\_role*   
The name of a role. The ownership of all the objects in the current database owned by this role will be reassigned to *new\_role*.

 *new\_role*   
The name of the role that will be made the new owner of the affected objects.

## Notes<a id="topic1__section5"></a>

`REASSIGN OWNED` is often used to prepare for the removal of one or more roles. Because `REASSIGN OWNED` only affects the objects in the current database, it is usually necessary to execute this command in each database that contains objects owned by a role that is to be removed.

The `DROP OWNED` command is an alternative that drops all the database objects owned by one or more roles.

The `REASSIGN OWNED` command does not affect the privileges granted to the old roles in objects that are not owned by them. Use `DROP OWNED` to revoke those privileges.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

Reassign any database objects owned by the role named `sally` and `bob` to `admin`;

``` pre
REASSIGN OWNED BY sally, bob TO admin;
```

## Compatibility<a id="topic1__section7"></a>

The `REASSIGN OWNED` statement is a HAWQ extension.
