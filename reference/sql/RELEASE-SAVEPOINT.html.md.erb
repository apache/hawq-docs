title: RELEASE SAVEPOINT
---

Destroys a previously defined savepoint.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
RELEASE [SAVEPOINT] savepoint_name
         
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`RELEASE SAVEPOINT` destroys a savepoint previously defined in the current transaction.

Destroying a savepoint makes it unavailable as a rollback point, but it has no other user visible behavior. It does not undo the effects of commands executed after the savepoint was established. (To do that, see /3/4.) Destroying a savepoint when it is no longer needed may allow the system to reclaim some resources earlier than transaction end.

`RELEASE SAVEPOINT` also destroys all savepoints that were established *after* the named savepoint was established.

## Parameters<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

 *savepoint\_name*   
The name of the savepoint to destroy.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section5"></a>

To establish and later destroy a savepoint:

``` pre
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (3);
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (4);
    RELEASE SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
COMMIT;
```

The above transaction will insert both 3 and 4.

## Compatibility<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

This command conforms to the SQL standard. The standard specifies that the key word `SAVEPOINT` is mandatory, but HAWQ allows it to be omitted.
