title: VACUUM
---

Garbage-collects and optionally analyzes a database.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
VACUUM [FULL] [FREEZE] [VERBOSE] [table]
VACUUM [FULL] [FREEZE] [VERBOSE] ANALYZE
              [table [(column [, ...] )]]
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`VACUUM` reclaims storage occupied by deleted tuples. In normal HAWQ operation, tuples that are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from their table; they remain present on disk until a `VACUUM` is done. Therefore it is necessary to do `VACUUM` periodically, especially on frequently-updated catalog tables. `VACUUM` has no effect on a normal HAWQ table, since the delete or update operations are not supported on normal HAWQ table.

With no parameter, `VACUUM` processes every table in the current database. With a parameter, `VACUUM` processes only that table. `VACUUM ANALYZE` performs a `VACUUM` and then an `ANALYZE` for each selected table. This is a handy combination form for routine maintenance scripts. See [ANALYZE](ANALYZE.html) for more details about its processing.

Plain `VACUUM` (without `FULL`) simply reclaims space and makes it available for re-use. This form of the command can operate in parallel with normal reading and writing of the table, as an exclusive lock is not obtained. `VACUUM FULL` does more extensive processing, including moving of tuples across blocks to try to compact the table to the minimum number of disk blocks. This form is much slower and requires an exclusive lock on each table while it is being processed.

**Outputs**
When `VERBOSE` is specified, `VACUUM` emits progress messages to indicate which table is currently being processed. Various statistics about the tables are printed as well.

## Parameters<a id="topic1__section5"></a>

FULL  
Selects a full vacuum, which may reclaim more space but takes much longer and exclusively locks the table.

**Note:** A VACUUM FULL is not recommended in HAWQ. See [Notes](#topic1__section6).

FREEZE  
Specifying `FREEZE` is equivalent to performing `VACUUM` with the `vacuum_freeze_min_age` server configuration parameter set to zero. The `FREEZE` option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Set the parameter by using `hawq config` or by modifying your `hawq-site.xml` configuration file instead.

VERBOSE  
Prints a detailed vacuum activity report for each table.

ANALYZE  
Updates statistics used by the planner to determine the most efficient way to execute a query.

 *table*   
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a specific table to vacuum. Defaults to all tables in the current database.

 *column*   
The name of a specific column to analyze. Defaults to all columns.

## Notes<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

`VACUUM` cannot be executed inside a transaction block.

A recommended practice is to vacuum active production databases frequently (at least nightly), in order to remove expired rows. After adding or deleting a large number of rows, it may be a good idea to issue a `VACUUM ANALYZE` command for the affected table. This will update the system catalogs with the results of all recent changes, and allow the HAWQ query planner to make better choices in planning queries.

`VACUUM` causes a substantial increase in I/O traffic, which can cause poor performance for other active sessions. Therefore, it is advisable to vacuum the database at low usage times. The `auto vacuum` daemon feature, that automates the execution of `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` commands is currently disabled in HAWQ.

Expired rows are held in what is called the *free space map*. The free space map must be sized large enough to cover the dead rows of all tables in your database. If not sized large enough, space occupied by dead rows that overflow the free space map cannot be reclaimed by a regular `VACUUM` command.

`VACUUM FULL` will reclaim all expired row space, but is a very expensive operation and may take an unacceptably long time to finish on large, distributed HAWQ tables. If you do get into a situation where the free space map has overflowed, it may be more timely to recreate the table with a `CREATE TABLE AS` statement and drop the old table.

`VACUUM FULL` is not recommended in HAWQ. It is best to size the free space map appropriately. The free space map is configured with the following server configuration parameters:

-   `max_fsm_pages`
-   `max_fsm_relations`

## Examples<a id="topic1__section7"></a>

Vacuum all tables in the current database:

``` pre
VACUUM;
```

Vacuum a specific table only:

``` pre
VACUUM mytable;
```

Vacuum all tables in the current database and collect statistics for the query planner:

``` pre
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```

## Compatibility<a id="topic1__section8"></a>

There is no `VACUUM` statement in the SQL standard.
