``` pre
DROP USER [IF EXISTS] name [, ...]
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

`DROP USER` is an obsolete command, though still accepted for backwards compatibility. Groups (and users) have been superseded by the more general concept of roles. See [DROP ROLE](DROP-ROLE.html) for more information.

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Parameters

IF EXISTS  
Do not throw an error if the role does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

 *name*   
The name of an existing role.

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Compatibility

There is no `DROP USER` statement in the SQL standard. The SQL standard leaves the definition of users to the implementation.
