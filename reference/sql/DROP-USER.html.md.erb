title: DROP USER
---

Removes a database role.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
DROP USER [IF EXISTS] name [, ...]
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`DROP USER` is an obsolete command, though still accepted for backwards compatibility. Groups (and users) have been superseded by the more general concept of roles. See [DROP ROLE](DROP-ROLE.html) for more information.

## Parameters<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

IF EXISTS  
Do not throw an error if the role does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

 *name*   
The name of an existing role.

## Compatibility<a id="topic1__section5"></a>

There is no `DROP USER` statement in the SQL standard. The SQL standard leaves the definition of users to the implementation.
