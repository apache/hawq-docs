title: DROP SEQUENCE
---

Removes a sequence.

## Synopsis<a id="topic1__section2"></a>

``` pre
DROP SEQUENCE [IF EXISTS] name [, ...] [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

## Description<a id="topic1__section3"></a>

`DROP SEQUENCE` removes a sequence generator table. You must own the sequence to drop it (or be a superuser).

## Parameters<a id="topic1__section4"></a>

IF EXISTS  
Do not throw an error if the sequence does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

 *name*   
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the sequence to remove.

CASCADE  
Automatically drop objects that depend on the sequence.

RESTRICT  
Refuse to drop the sequence if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples<a id="topic1__section5"></a>

Remove the sequence `myserial`:

``` pre
DROP SEQUENCE myserial;
```

## Compatibility<a id="topic1__section6"></a>

`DROP SEQUENCE` is fully conforming with the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one sequence to be dropped per command. Also, the `IF           EXISTS` option is a HAWQ extension.
