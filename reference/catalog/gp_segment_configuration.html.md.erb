| `registration_order` | integer |            | When HAWQ starts, the master and each segment starts itself separately. This column indicates the order in which a segment node registers itself to master node. The registration\_order for segments starts from 1. Master's registration\_order is 0. Standby's registration\_order is -1. |
| `role`               | char    |            | The role that a node is currently running as. Values are `p` (segment), `m`(master) or `s               `(standby).                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `status`             | char    |            | The fault status of a segment. Values are `u` (up) or `d` (down).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `port`               | integer |            | The TCP port the database server listener process is using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `failed_tmpdir_num`  | integer |            | The number of failed temporary directories on the segment. User- configured temporary directories may fail on segments due to disk errors. This information is reported to the master.                                                                                                       |
