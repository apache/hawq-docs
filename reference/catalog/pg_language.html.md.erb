| column          | type        | references   | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lanname`       | name        |              | Name of the language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `lanispl `      | boolean     |              | This is false for internal languages (such as SQL) and true for user-defined languages. Currently, `pg_dump` still uses this to determine which languages need to be dumped, but this may be replaced by a different mechanism in the future. |
| `lanpltrusted ` | boolean     |              | True if this is a trusted language, which means that it is believed not to grant access to anything outside the normal SQL execution environment. Only superusers may create functions in untrusted languages.                                |
| `lanplcallfoid` | oid         | pg\_proc.oid | For noninternal languages this references the language handler, which is a special function that is responsible for executing all functions that are written in the particular language.                                                      |
| `lanvalidator`  | oid         | pg\_proc.oid | This references a language validator function that is responsible for checking the syntax and validity of new functions when they are created. Zero if no validator is provided.                                                              |
| `lanacl `       | aclitem\[\] |              | Access privileges for the language.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
