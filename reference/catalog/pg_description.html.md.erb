title: pg_description
---

The `pg_description` system catalog table stores optional descriptions (comments) for each database object. Descriptions can be manipulated with the `COMMENT` command and viewed with `psql`'s `\d` meta-commands. Descriptions of many built-in system objects are provided in the initial contents of `pg_description`. See also [pg\_shdescription](pg_shdescription.html#topic1), which performs a similar function for descriptions involving objects that are shared across a HAWQ system.
