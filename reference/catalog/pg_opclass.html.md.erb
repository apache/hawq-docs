title: pg_opclass
---

The `pg_opclass` system catalog table defines index access method operator classes. Each operator class defines semantics for index columns of a particular data type and a particular index access method. Note that there can be multiple operator classes for a given data type/access method combination, thus supporting multiple behaviors. The majority of the information defining an operator class is actually not in its `pg_opclass` row, but in the associated rows in [pg\_amop](pg_amop.html#topic1) and [pg\_amproc](pg_amproc.html#topic1). Those rows are considered to be part of the operator class definition — this is not unlike the way that a relation is defined by a single [pg\_class](pg_class.html#topic1) row plus associated rows in [pg\_attribute](pg_attribute.html#topic1) and other tables.
