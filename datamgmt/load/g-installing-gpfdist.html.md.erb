title: Installing gpfdist
---

`gpfdist` is installed in `$GPHOME/bin` of your HAWQ master host installation. Run `gpfdist` from a machine other than the HAWQ master, such as on a machine devoted to ETL processing. If you want to install `gpfdist` on your ETL server, get it from the *Greenplum Load Tools* package and follow its installation instructions.
