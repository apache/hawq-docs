title: Disabling EXECUTE for Web or Writable External Tables
---

There is a security risk associated with allowing external tables to execute OS commands or scripts. To disable the use of `EXECUTE` in web and writable external table definitions, set the `gp_external_enable_exec server` configuration parameter to off in your master `hawq-site.xml` file:

``` pre
gp_external_enable_exec = off
```
