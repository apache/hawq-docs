title: Troubleshooting gpfdist
---

The segments access `gpfdist` at runtime. Ensure that the HAWQ segment hosts have network access to `gpfdist`. `gpfdist` is a web server: test connectivity by running the following command from each host in the HAWQ array (segments and master):

``` shell
$ wget http://gpfdist_hostname:port/filename      
```

The `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` definition must have the correct host name, port, and file names for `gpfdist`. Specify file names and paths relative to the directory from which `gpfdist` serves files (the directory path specified when `gpfdist` started). See [Creating External Tables - Examples](creating-external-tables-examples.html#topic44).

If you start `gpfdist` on your system and IPv6 networking is disabled, `gpfdist` displays this warning message when testing for an IPv6 port.

``` pre
[WRN gpfdist.c:2050] Creating the socket failed
```

If the corresponding IPv4 port is available, `gpfdist` uses that port and the warning for IPv6 port can be ignored. To see information about the ports that `gpfdist` tests, use the `-V` option.

For information about IPv6 and IPv4 networking, see your operating system documentation.
