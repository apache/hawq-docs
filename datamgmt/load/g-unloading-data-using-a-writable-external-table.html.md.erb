title: Unloading Data Using a Writable External Table
---

Writable external tables allow only `INSERT` operations. You must grant `INSERT` permission on a table to enable access to users who are not the table owner or a superuser. For example:

``` pre
GRANT INSERT ON writable_ext_table TO admin;
```

To unload data using a writable external table, select the data from the source table(s) and insert it into the writable external table. The resulting rows are output to the writable external table. For example:

``` pre
INSERT INTO writable_ext_table SELECT * FROM regular_table;
```
