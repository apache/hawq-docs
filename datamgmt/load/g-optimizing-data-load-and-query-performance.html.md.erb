title: Optimizing Data Load and Query Performance
---

Use the following tips to help optimize your data load and subsequent query performance.

-   Run `ANALYZE` after loading data. If you significantly altered the data in a table, run `ANALYZE` or `VACUUM                     ANALYZE` to update table statistics for the query optimizer. Current statistics ensure that the optimizer makes the best decisions during query planning and avoids poor performance due to inaccurate or nonexistent statistics.
-   Run `VACUUM` after load errors. If the load operation does not run in single row error isolation mode, the operation stops at the first error. The target table contains the rows loaded before the error occurred. You cannot access these rows, but they occupy disk space. Use the `VACUUM` command to recover the wasted space.
