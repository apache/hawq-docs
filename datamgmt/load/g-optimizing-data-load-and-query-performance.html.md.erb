title: Optimizing Data Load and Query Performance
---

Use the following tip to help optimize your data load and subsequent query performance.

-   Run `ANALYZE` after loading data. If you significantly altered the data in a table, run `ANALYZE` or `VACUUM                     ANALYZE` (system catalog tables only) to update table statistics for the query optimizer. Current statistics ensure that the optimizer makes the best decisions during query planning and avoids poor performance due to inaccurate or nonexistent statistics.
