title: Load the Data
---

Create the tables with SQL statements based on the appropriate schema.

There are no special requirements for the HAWQ tables that hold loaded data. In the prices example, the following command creates the appropriate table.

``` pre
CREATE TABLE prices (
  itemnumber integer,       
  price       decimal        
) 
DISTRIBUTED BY (itemnumber);
```
