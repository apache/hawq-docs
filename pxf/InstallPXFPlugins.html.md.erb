title: Installing PXF Plug-ins
---

This topic describes how to install the built-in PXF service plug-ins that are required to connect PXF to HDFS, Hive, and HBase. 

**Note:** The PXF plug-ins require that you run Tomcat on the host machine. Tomcat reserves ports 8005, 8080, and 8009. If you have configured Oozie JXM reporting on a host that will run a PXF plug-in, make sure that the reporting service uses a port other than 8005. This helps to prevent port conflict errors from occurring when you start the PXF service.

## <a id="directories_and_logs"></a>PXF Installation and Log File Directories

Installing PXF plug-ins, regardless of method, creates directories and log files on each node receiving the plug-in installation:

| Directory                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## <a id="install_pxf_plug_ambari"></a>Installing PXF Plug-ins Using Ambari

If you are using Ambari to install and manage your HAWQ cluster, you do *not* need to follow the manual installation steps in this topic. Installing using the Ambari web interface installs all of the necessary PXF plug-in components.

## <a id="install_pxf_plug_cmdline"></a>Installing PXF Plug-ins from the Command Line

Each PXF service plug-in resides in its own RPM.  You may have built these RPMs in the Apache HAWQ open source project repository (see [PXF Build Instructions](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hawq/blob/master/pxf/README.md)), or these RPMs may have been included in a commercial product download package.

RPMs for PXF plug-ins must be installed on *each* node in your cluster.  The PXF service must be restarted on each node after installation of plug-ins.

### <a id="topic_qsz_wq5_25"></a>Install Prerequisite Packages
All PXF plug-ins require that both the Tomcat and PXF service packages be installed on each node in your cluster. 

Install Tomcat:

```shell
$ sudo rpm -i apache-tomcat-x.x.x.noarch.rpm
```
    
where *x.x.x* corresponds to the version of Tomcat required by PXF.  The appropriate version of Tomcat is included in the PXF RPM bundle.

Install the PXF service:

```shell
$ sudo rpm -i pxf-service-n.n.n-x.noarch.rpm
```

where *n.n.n-x* corresponds to the PXF version and build number you wish to install.

Installing the PXF service package:

   - creates a `/usr/lib/pxf-n.n.n` directory, adding a softlink from `/usr/lib/pxf` to this directory
   - copies the PXF service JAR file `pxf-service-n.n.n.jar` to `/usr/lib/pxf-n.n.n/`
   - creates a softlink to `pxf-service.jar` in `/usr/lib/pxf-n.n.n/`
   - sets up the PXF service configuration files
   - starts the PXF service


### <a id="topic_qsz_wq5_25"></a>Install the PXF HDFS Plug-in

To install PXF support for HDFS, perform the following steps on *each* node in your cluster:

1. Install the Tomcat and PXF service packages as described in the previous section.

2. Install the PXF HDFS plug-in:

    ```shell
    $ sudo rpm -i pxf-hdfs-n.n.n-x.noarch.rpm
    ```

    The install copies the HDFS JAR file `pxf-hdfs-n.n.n.jar` to `/usr/lib/pxf-n.n.n/` and creates a softlink to `pxf-hdfs.jar` in that directory.

### <a id="topic_s1y_1v5_25"></a>Install the PXF Hive Plug-in

To install PXF support for Hive, perform the following steps on *each* node in your cluster:

1.  Install the Tomcat, PXF service, and PXF HDFS RPMs as previously described.

2.  Install the PXF Hive plug-in:

    ```shell
    $ sudo rpm -i pxf-hive-n.n.n-x.noarch.rpm
    ```

    The install copies the Hive JAR file `pxf-hive-n.n.n.jar` to `/usr/lib/pxf-n.n.n` and creates a softlink to `pxf-hive.jar` in that directory.

### <a id="topic_std_cv5_25"></a>Install the PXF HBase Plug-in

To install PXF support for HBase, perform the following steps on *each* node in your cluster. 

1.  Install the Tomcat, PXF Service, and PXF HDFS RPMs as previously described.

2.  Install the PXF HBase plug-in:

    ```shell
    $ sudo rpm -i pxf-hbase-n.n.n-x.noarch.rpm
    ```

    The install copies the HBase JAR file `pxf-hbase-n.n.n.jar` to `/usr/lib/pxf-n.n.n` and creates a softlink to `pxf-hbase.jar` in that directory.

3.  Add the PXF HBase plug-in JAR file to the HBase `CLASSPATH` by updating the `HBASE_CLASSPATH` environment variable setting in the HBase environment file `/etc/hbase/conf/hbase-env.sh`:

    ```shell
    export HBASE_CLASSPATH=${HBASE_CLASSPATH}:/usr/lib/pxf/pxf-hbase.jar
    ```

4.  Restart the HBase service after making this update to HBase configuration.

    If you are on the HBase Master node:

    ```shell
    $ su -l hbase -c "/usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/hbase-daemon.sh restart master; sleep 25"
    ```

    If you are on an HBase Region Server node:

    ```shell
    $ su -l hbase -c "/usr/hdp/current/hbase-regionserver/bin/hbase-daemon.sh restart regionserver"
    ```

### <a id="topic_s1y_1v5_25"></a>Install the PXF JSON Plug-in

To install PXF support for JSON, perform the following steps on *each* node in your cluster:

1.  Install the Tomcat, PXF service, and PXF HDFS RPMs as previously described.

2.  Install the PXF JSON plug-in:

    ```shell
    $ sudo rpm -i pxf-json-n.n.n-x.noarch.rpm
    ```

    The install copies the JSON JAR file `pxf-json-n.n.n.jar` to `/usr/lib/pxf-n.n.n` and creates a softlink to `pxf-json.jar` in that directory.

### <a id="topic_qsz_restartpxf"></a>Restart the PXF Service
Restart PXF on *each* node after installing the PXF service and any PXF plug-ins.

``` shell
$ sudo service pxf-service restart
```
