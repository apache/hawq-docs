title: Using HAWQ Built-In Languages
---

This section provides an introduction to using the HAWQ built-in languages.

HAWQ supports user-defined functions created with the SQL and C built-in languages. HAWQ also supports user-defined aliases for internal functions.


## <a id="enablebuiltin"></a>Enabling Built-in Language Support

Support for SQL, internal, and C language user-defined functions is enabled by default for all HAWQ databases.

## <a id="builtinsql"></a>SQL

SQL functions execute an arbitrary list of SQL statements. The SQL statements in the body of an SQL function must be separated by semicolons. The final statement in a non-void-returning SQL function must be a [SELECT](../reference/sql/SELECT.html) that returns data of the type specified by the function's return type. The function will return a single or set of rows corresponding to this last SQL query.

The following example creates and calls an SQL function to count the number of rows of the database named `orders`:

``` sql
gpadmin=# CREATE FUNCTION count_orders() RETURNS bigint AS $$
 SELECT count(*) FROM orders;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;
CREATE FUNCTION
gpadmin=# select count_orders();
 my_count 
----------
   830513
(1 row)
```

For additional information on creating SQL functions, refer to [Query Language (SQL) Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/xfunc-sql.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

## <a id="builtininternal"></a>Internal

Many HAWQ internal functions are written in C. These functions are declared during initialization of the database cluster and statically linked to the HAWQ server. See [Built-in Functions and Operators](../query/functions-operators.html#topic29) for detailed information on HAWQ internal functions.

While users cannot define new internal functions, they can create aliases for existing internal functions.

The following example creates a new function named `all_caps` that will be defined as an alias for the `upper` HAWQ internal function:


``` sql
gpadmin=# CREATE FUNCTION all_caps (text) RETURNS text AS 'upper'
            LANGUAGE internal STRICT;
CREATE FUNCTION
gpadmin=# SELECT all_caps('change me');
 all_caps  
-----------
 CHANGE ME
(1 row)

```

For more information on aliasing internal functions, refer to [Internal Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/xfunc-internal.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

## <a id="builtininternal"></a>C

User-defined functions written in C must be compiled into shared libraries to be loaded by the HAWQ server on demand. This dynamic loading distinguishes C language functions from internal functions that are written in C.

The [CREATE FUNCTION](../reference/sql/CREATE-FUNCTION.html) call for a user-defined C function must include both the name of the shared library and the name of the function.

If an absolute path to the shared library is not provided, an attempt is made to locate the library relative to the: 

1. HAWQ PostgreSQL library directory (obtained via the `pg_config --pkglibdir` command)
2. `dynamic_library_path` configuration value
3. current working directory

in that order. 

Example:

``` c
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"

#ifdef PG_MODULE_MAGIC
PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
#endif

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(double_it);
         
Datum
double_it(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    int32   arg = PG_GETARG_INT32(0);

    PG_RETURN_INT64(arg + arg);
}
```

If the above function is compiled into a shared object named `libdoubleit.so` located in `/share/libs`, you would register and invoke the function with HAWQ as follows:

``` sql
gpadmin=# CREATE FUNCTION double_it_c(integer) RETURNS integer
            AS '/share/libs/libdoubleit', 'double_it'
            LANGUAGE C STRICT;
CREATE FUNCTION
gpadmin=# SELECT double_it_c(27);
 double_it 
-----------
        54
(1 row)

```

The shared library `.so` extension may be omitted.
