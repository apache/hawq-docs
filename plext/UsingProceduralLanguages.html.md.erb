title: Using Languages and Extensions in HAWQ
---

HAWQ supports user-defined functions that are created with the SQL and C built-in languages, and also supports user-defined aliases for internal functions.

HAWQ also supports user-defined functions written in languages other than SQL and C. These other languages are generically called *procedural languages* (PLs) and are extensions to the core HAWQ functionality. HAWQ specifically supports the PL/Java, PL/Perl, PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, and PL/R procedural languages. 

HAWQ additionally provides the `pgcrypto` extension for password hashing and data encryption.

This chapter describes these languages and extensions:
