title: Supported Client Applications
---

Users can connect to HAWQ using various client applications:

-   A number of [HAWQ Client Applications](g-greenplum-database-client-applications.html) are provided with your HAWQ installation. The `psql` client application provides an interactive command-line interface to HAWQ.
-   Using standard [Database Application Interfaces](g-database-application-interfaces.html), such as ODBC and JDBC, users can create their own client applications that interface to HAWQ. Because HAWQ is based on PostgreSQL, it uses the standard PostgreSQL database drivers.
