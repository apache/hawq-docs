# Creating and Managing Views {#topic_i3c_qwy_sp}

Views enable you to save frequently used or complex queries, then access them in a `SELECT` statement as if they were a table. A view is not physically materialized on disk: the query runs as a subquery when you access the view.

If a subquery is associated with a single query, consider using the `WITH` clause of the `SELECT` command instead of creating a seldom-used view.

## Creating Views {#topic101}

The `CREATE VIEW`command defines a view of a query. For example:

```
CREATE VIEW comedies AS SELECT * FROM films WHERE kind = 'comedy';

```

Views ignore `ORDER BY` and `SORT` operations stored in the view.

## Dropping Views {#topic102}

The `DROP VIEW` command removes a view. For example:

```
DROP VIEW topten;

```
