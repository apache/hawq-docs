Your HAWQ 2.2.0 installation includes the following HAWQ-related Ranger components:

- Ranger Administrative UI
- HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service

The Ranger Administrative UI is installed when you install HDP. You configure the Ranger service itself through Ambari. You configure HAWQ-Ranger authorization policies through the Ranger Administrative UI, which you can access at `http://<ranger-admin-node>:6080`. 

Installing or upgrading to HAWQ 2.2.0 installs the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service, but neither configures nor registers the plug-in.  

To use Ranger for managing HAWQ authentication events, you must first install and register several HAWQ JAR files on the Ranger Administration host. This one-time configuration establishes connectivity to your HAWQ cluster from the Ranger Administration host. 

After registering the JAR files, you enable or disable Ranger integration in HAWQ by setting the `hawq_acl_type` configuration parameter. When Ranger is enabled, all access to HAWQ resources is controlled through Ranger security policies. The HAWQ Ranger Plug-in pre-populates Ranger with HAWQ policies to allow `gpadmin` superuser access to all resources. See [Creating HAWQ Authorization Policies in Ranger](ranger-policy-creation.html) for information about creating policies in Ranger.

Use the following procedures to register the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service and enable Ranger authorization for HAWQ.

## <a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisites
To use HAWQ Ranger integration, install a compatible Hadoop distribution and Apache Ranger 0.6. You must also have `admin` access to the **Ranger Admin UI**.

## <a id="jar"></a>Step 1: Install Ranger Connectivity to HAWQ
1. `ssh` into the Ranger Administration host as a user with root privileges:

    ``` bash
    $ ssh root@<ranger-admin-node>
    root@ranger-admin-node$ 
    ```
2. Create the directory for the HAWQ JAR files:

    ``` bash
    root@ranger-admin-node$ cd /usr/hdp/current/ranger-admin/ews/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/ranger-plugins
    root@ranger-admin-node$ mkdir hawq
    ```
3. Copy the necessary HAWQ JAR files (`postgresql-9.1-901-1.jdbc4.jar` and `ranger-plugin-admin-2.2.0.0.jar`) from the HAWQ master node to the new directory:

    ``` bash
    root@ranger-admin-node$ scp <hawq-master>:/usr/local/hawq/ranger/lib/*.jar ./hawq
    ```
4. Change the ownership of the new folder and JAR files to the `ranger` user:

    ``` bash
    root@ranger-admin-node$ chown -R ranger:ranger hawq
    ```
5. The `enable-ranger-plugin.sh` script configures Ranger connectivity to your HAWQ cluster. The command has the syntax:

    ``` pre
    enable-ranger-plugin.sh -r <ranger_admin_node>:<ranger_port> -u <ranger_user> -p <ranger_password> -h <hawq_master>:<hawq_port> -w <hawq_user> -q <hawq_password>
    ```

    Log in to the HAWQ master node as the `gpadmin` user and execute the `enable-ranger-plugin.sh` script. Ensure that \<hawq_master\> identifies the fully qualified domain name of the HAWQ master node. For example:

    ``` bash
    gpadmin@master$ cd /usr/local/hawq/ranger/bin
    gpadmin@master$ ./enable-ranger-plugin.sh -r ranger_host:6080 -u admin -p admin -h hawq_master:5432 -w gpadmin -q gpadmin
    ```
    
    **Note**: You can also enter the short form of the command: `./enable-ranger-plugin.sh -r` and the script will prompt you for entries.
    
    When the script completes, the default HAWQ service definition is registered in the Ranger Admin UI. This service definition is named `hawq`.

6. Locate the `pg_hba.conf` file on the HAWQ master node, for example:
 
    ``` bash
    gpadmin@master$ hawq config --show hawq_master_directory
    GUC		: hawq_master_directory
    Value		: /data/hawq/master
    ```

    Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file on the HAWQ master node to configure HAWQ access for \<hawq_user\> on the \<ranger-admin-node\>. For example, you would add an entry similar to the following for the example `enable-ranger-plugin.sh` call above:

    ``` bash
    host  all     gpadmin    ranger_host/32       trust
    ```

    And reload HAWQ configuration:

    ``` bash
    gpadmin@master$ hawq stop cluster --reload
    ```

7.  When setup is complete, use the fully-qualified domain name to log into the Ambari server. Use the Ranger link in the left nav to bring up the Ranger Summary pane in the HAWQ Ambari interface. Use the Quick Links to access Ranger. This link will take you to the Ranger Login interface. 

8.  Log into the Ranger Access Manager. You will see a list of icons under the Service Manager. Click the **Edit** icon on the right, under the HAWQ service icon. Ensure that the Active Status is set to Enabled, and click the **Test Connection** button. You should receive a message that Ranger connected successfully.  If the connection fails, verify the `hawq` service Config Properties, as well as your `pg_hba.conf` entries, and re-test the connection.

## <a id="enable"></a>Step 2: Configure HAWQ to Use Ranger Policy Management

The default Ranger service definition for HAWQ assigns the HAWQ administrator (typically `gpadmin`) all privileges to all objects. 

Once the connection between HAWQ and Ranger is configured, you can either set up policies for the HAWQ users according to the procedures in [Creating HAWQ Authorization Policies in Ranger](ranger-policy-creation.html) or enable Ranger with only the default policies. 

**Note**: Any authorization defined using GRANT commands will no longer apply after enabling HAWQ Ranger. Only gpadmin access is allowed when Ranger is first initialized.

1. On Ambari, select the **HAWQ** Service, and then select the **Configs** tab.
2. Select the **Advanced** tab, and then expand **Custom hawq-site**.
4. Click **Add Property...** and add the new property, `hawq_acl_type=ranger` property. (If the property already exists, change its value from `standalone` (the default) to `ranger`.)
5. Click **Save** to save your changes.
6. Select **Service Actions > Restart All** and confirm that you want to restart the HAWQ cluster.


## <a id="rpsadminstate"></a>Obtaining the Status of HAWQ/Ranger Integration

Determine the status of HAWQ/Ranger integration in your cluster by:

- Examining the HAWQ packages on your system to verify that you have installed the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service. The HAWQ Ranger Plug-in is installed when you install HAWQ.

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@master$ rpm -qa | grep hawq-ranger
    hawq-ranger-plugin_2_2_0_0-2.2.0.0-4134.el6.noarch
    ```

- Examining the Ranger Admin UI **Service Manager** page. If this page includes a HAWQ service definition named `hawq`, you have successfully registered the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service.

- Identifying the access control method currently in place in your HAWQ cluster. If the `hawq_acl_type` server configuration parameter value is  set to `ranger`, you have enabled Ranger authorization for HAWQ.

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@master$ hawq config -s hawq_acl_type
    GUC       : hawq_acl_type
    Value     : ranger
    ```

- Querying the state of your HAWQ cluster. If `hawq state` or Ambari **HAWQ Service Check** output identifies that the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service status is Active, the plug-in is up and running:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@master$ hawq state
    ...
    20170327:16:35:06:508426 hawq_state:master:gpadmin-[INFO]:--   Current HAWQ acl type                          = ranger
    20170327:16:35:06:508426 hawq_state:master:gpadmin-[INFO]:--   HAWQ Ranger plugin service state               = Active
    ...
    ```


## <a id="customconfig"></a> Custom Configuration

Configuration files for the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service are located in the `$GPHOME/ranger/etc` directory. These files include:

| File     |  Description     |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| ranger-hawq-audit.xml |  HAWQ Ranger audit-related configuration, including the audit provider (log4j, Solr, HDFS) and provider-specific configuration |
| ranger-hawq-security.xml |  HAWQ Ranger service configuration, including the policy change polling interval |
| rps.properties |  HAWQ Ranger deployment-related configuration, including the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service port definition and JVM parameters|

Any configuration changes you make after you have registered the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in require a restart of the service. You can either restart the HAWQ cluster or restart just the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service:

``` shell
gpadmin@master$ /usr/local/hawq/ranger/bin/rps.sh stop
gpadmin@master$ /usr/local/hawq/ranger/bin/rps.sh start
```

### <a id="caching"></a>Changing the Frequency of Policy Caching
 
The default polling interval for HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service policy updates is 30 seconds. To increase or decrease this value, update the `ranger.plugin.hawq.policy.pollIntervalMs` property setting in the `ranger-hawq-security.xml` file:

<pre>
&lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;ranger.plugin.hawq.policy.pollIntervalMs&lt;/name&gt;
    <b>&lt;value&gt;30000&lt;/value&gt;</b>
    &lt;description&gt;
        How often to poll for changes in policies?
    &lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</pre>

Provide a value in milliseconds.

You must restart the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service as described above after updating the polling interval.
