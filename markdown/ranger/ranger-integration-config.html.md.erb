Your HAWQ 2.2.0 installation includes the following HAWQ-related Ranger components:

- Ranger Administrative UI
- HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service

The Ranger Administrative UI is installed when you install HDP. You configure the Ranger service itself through Ambari. You configure HAWQ-Ranger authorization policies through the Ranger Administrative UI, which you can access at `http://<ranger-admin-node>:6080`. 

Installing or upgrading to HAWQ 2.2.0 installs the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service, but neither configures nor registers the plug-in.  

To use Ranger for managing HAWQ authentication events, you must first install and register several HAWQ JAR files on the Ranger Administration host. This one-time configuration establishes connectivity to your HAWQ cluster from the Ranger Administration host. 

After registering the JAR files, you enable or disable Ranger integration in HAWQ by setting the `hawq_acl_type` configuration parameter. When Ranger is enabled, all access to HAWQ resources is controlled through Ranger security policies. The HAWQ Ranger Plug-in pre-populates Ranger with HAWQ policies to allow `gpadmin` superuser access to all resources. See [Creating HAWQ Authorization Policies in Ranger](ranger-policy-creation.html) for information about creating policies in Ranger.

Use the following procedures to register the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service and enable Ranger authorization for HAWQ.

## <a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisites
To use HAWQ Ranger integration, install a compatible Hadoop distribution and Apache Ranger 0.6. You must also have `admin` access to the **Ranger Admin UI**.

## <a id="jar"></a>Step 1: Install Ranger Connectivity to HAWQ
1. `ssh` into the Ranger Administration host as a user with root privileges:

    ``` bash
    $ ssh root@<ranger-admin-node>
    root@ranger-admin-node$ 
    ```
2. Create the directory for the HAWQ JAR files:

    ``` bash
    root@ranger-admin-node$ cd /usr/hdp/current/ranger-admin/ews/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/ranger-plugins
    root@ranger-admin-node$ mkdir hawq
    ```
3. Copy the necessary HAWQ JAR files (`postgresql-9.1-901-1.jdbc4.jar` and `ranger-plugin-admin-2.2.0.0.jar`) from the HAWQ master node to the new directory:

    ``` bash
    root@ranger-admin-node$ scp <hawq-master>:/usr/local/hawq/ranger/lib/*.jar ./hawq
    ```
4. Change the ownership of the new folder and JAR files to the `ranger` user:

    ``` bash
    root@ranger-admin-node$ chown -R ranger:ranger hawq
    ```
5. The `enable-ranger-plugin.sh` script configures Ranger connectivity to your HAWQ cluster. The command has the syntax:

    ``` pre
    enable-ranger-plugin.sh -r <ranger_admin_node>:<ranger_port> -u <ranger_user> -p <ranger_password> -h <hawq_master>:<hawq_port> -w <hawq_user> -q <hawq_password>
    ```

    Log in to the HAWQ master node as the `gpadmin` user and execute the `enable-ranger-plugin.sh` script. Ensure that \<hawq_master\> identifies the fully qualified domain name of the HAWQ master node. For example:

    ``` bash
    gpadmin@master$ cd /usr/local/hawq/ranger/bin
    gpadmin@master$ ./enable-ranger-plugin.sh -r ranger_host:6080 -u admin -p admin -h hawq_master:5432 -w gpadmin -q gpadmin

    RANGER URL  = ranger_host:6080
    RANGER User = admin
    RANGER Password = [*****]
    HAWQ HOST = hawq_master
    HAWQ PORT = 5432
    HAWQ User = gpadmin
    HAWQ Password = [*******]
    HAWQ service definition was not found in Ranger Admin, creating it by uploading /usr/local/hawq_2_2_0_0/ranger/etc/ranger-servicedef-hawq.json
    HAWQ service instance was not found in Ranger Admin, creating it.
    Updated POLICY_MGR_URL to http://ranger_host:6080 in /usr/local/hawq_2_2_0_0/ranger/etc/rps.properties
    Updated default value of JAVA_HOME to /usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_77 in /usr/local/hawq_2_2_0_0/ranger/etc/rps.properties
    ```
    
    **Note**: You can also enter the short form of the command: `./enable-ranger-plugin.sh -r` and the script will prompt you for entries.
    
    When the script completes, the default HAWQ service definition is registered in the Ranger Admin UI. This service definition is named `hawq`.

6. Locate the `pg_hba.conf` file in the master directory of the HAWQ master node. To display the HAWQ master directory:
 
    ``` bash
    gpadmin@master$ hawq config --show hawq_master_directory
    GUC		: hawq_master_directory
    Value	: /data/hawq/master
    ```

    Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file on the HAWQ master node to configure HAWQ access for \<hawq_user\> on the \<ranger-admin-node\>. For example, you would add an entry similar to the following for the example `enable-ranger-plugin.sh` call above:

    ``` bash
    host  all     gpadmin    ranger_host/32       trust
    ```

    And reload HAWQ configuration:

    ``` bash
    gpadmin@master$ hawq stop cluster --reload
    ```

7.  After HAWQ reloads the configuration, use the fully-qualified domain name to log into the Ambari server. Click the **Ranger** link to display the Ranger Summary page, then select **Quick Links > Ranger Admin UI**. 

8.  Log into the Ranger Access Manager. Click the **Edit** button for the **HAWQ** service. Ensure that the Active Status is set to Enabled, and click **Test Connection**. You should receive a message that Ranger connected successfully.  If the connection fails, verify the `hawq` service Config Properties, as well as your `pg_hba.conf` entries, and re-test the connection.

## <a id="enable"></a>Step 2: Configure HAWQ to Use Ranger Policy Management

The default Ranger service definition for HAWQ assigns the HAWQ administrator (typically `gpadmin`) all privileges to all objects. 

Once the connection between HAWQ and Ranger is configured, you can either set up policies for the HAWQ users according to the procedures in [Creating HAWQ Authorization Policies in Ranger](ranger-policy-creation.html) or enable Ranger with only the default policies. 

**Note**: Any authorization defined using GRANT commands will no longer apply after enabling HAWQ Ranger. Only gpadmin access is allowed when Ranger is first initialized.

1. On Ambari, select the **HAWQ** Service, and then select the **Configs** tab.
2. Select the **Advanced** tab, and then expand **Custom hawq-site**.
4. Click **Add Property...** and add the new property, `hawq_acl_type=ranger` property. (If the property already exists, change its value from `standalone` (the default) to `ranger`.)
5. Click **Save** to save your changes.
6. Select **Service Actions > Restart All** and confirm that you want to restart the HAWQ cluster.


## <a id="customconfig"></a> Custom Configuration

Configuration files for the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service are located in the `$GPHOME/ranger/etc` directory. These files include:

| File     |  Description     |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| ranger-hawq-audit.xml |  HAWQ Ranger audit-related configuration, including the audit provider (log4j, Solr, HDFS) and provider-specific configuration |
| ranger-hawq-security.xml |  HAWQ Ranger service configuration, including the policy change polling interval |
| rps.properties |  HAWQ Ranger deployment-related configuration, including the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service port definition and JVM parameters|

Any configuration changes you make after you have registered the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in require a restart of the service. You can either restart the HAWQ cluster or restart just the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service:

``` shell
gpadmin@master$ /usr/local/hawq/ranger/bin/rps.sh stop
gpadmin@master$ /usr/local/hawq/ranger/bin/rps.sh start
```

### <a id="caching"></a>Changing the Frequency of Policy Caching
 
The default polling interval for HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service policy updates is 30 seconds. To increase or decrease this value, update the `ranger.plugin.hawq.policy.pollIntervalMs` property setting in the `ranger-hawq-security.xml` file:

<pre>
&lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;ranger.plugin.hawq.policy.pollIntervalMs&lt;/name&gt;
    <b>&lt;value&gt;30000&lt;/value&gt;</b>
    &lt;description&gt;
        How often to poll for changes in policies?
    &lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</pre>

Provide a value in milliseconds.

You must restart the HAWQ Ranger Plug-in Service as described above after updating the polling interval.
