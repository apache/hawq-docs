---

Removes an operator class.

## <a id="topic1__section2"></a>Synopsis

``` pre
DROP OPERATOR CLASS [IF EXISTS] <name> USING <index_method> [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

`DROP OPERATOR` drops an existing operator class. To execute this command you must be the owner of the operator class.

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Parameters

<dt>IF EXISTS  </dt>
<dd>Do not throw an error if the operator class does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.</dd>

<dt>\<name\>   </dt>
<dd>The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator class.</dd>

<dt>\<index\_method\>   </dt>
<dd>The name of the index access method the operator class is for.</dd>

<dt>CASCADE  </dt>
<dd>Automatically drop objects that depend on the operator class.</dd>

<dt>RESTRICT  </dt>
<dd>Refuse to drop the operator class if any objects depend on it. This is the default.</dd>

## Notes

This command will not succeed if there are any existing indexes that use the operator class. Add `CASCADE` to drop such indexes along with the operator class.

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Examples

Remove the B-tree operator class `widget_ops`:

``` pre
DROP OPERATOR CLASS widget_ops USING btree;
```

This command will not succeed if there are any existing indexes that use the operator class. Add `CASCADE` to drop such indexes along with the operator class.
