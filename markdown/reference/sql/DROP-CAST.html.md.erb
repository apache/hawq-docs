DROP CAST [IF EXISTS] (<sourcetype> AS <targettype>) [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

`DROP CAST` will delete a previously defined cast. To be able to drop a cast, you must own the source or the target data type. These are the same privileges that are required to create a cast.

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Parameters

<dt>IF EXISTS </dt>
<dd>Do not throw an error if the cast does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.</dd>

<dt>\<sourcetype\> </dt>
<dd>The name of the source data type of the cast to be removed.</dd>

<dt>\<targettype\> </dt>
<dd>The name of the target data type of the cast to be removed.</dd>

<dt>CASCADE</dt>
<dt>RESTRICT</dt>
<dd>These keywords have no effect since there are no dependencies on casts.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Examples

To drop the cast from type `text` to type `int`:

``` pre
DROP CAST (text AS int);
```
