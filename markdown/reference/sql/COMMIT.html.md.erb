Commits the current transaction.

## <a id="topic1__section2"></a>Synopsis

``` pre
COMMIT [WORK | TRANSACTION]
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

`COMMIT` commits the current transaction. All changes made by the transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if a crash occurs.

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Parameters

<dt>WORK  
TRANSACTION  </dt>
<dd>Optional key words. They have no effect.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Notes

Use [ROLLBACK](ROLLBACK.html) to abort a transaction.

Issuing `COMMIT` when not inside a transaction does no harm, but it will provoke a warning message.

## <a id="topic1__section6"></a>Examples

To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

``` pre
COMMIT;
```

## <a id="topic1__section7"></a>Compatibility

The SQL standard only specifies the two forms `COMMIT` and `COMMIT           WORK`. Otherwise, this command is fully conforming.
