Removes a schema.

## <a id="topic1__section2"></a>Synopsis

``` pre
DROP SCHEMA [IF EXISTS] <name> [, ...] [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

`DROP SCHEMA` removes schemas from the database. A schema can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser. Note that the owner can drop the schema (and thereby all contained objects) even if he does not own some of the objects within the schema.

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Parameters

<dt>IF EXISTS  </dt>
<dd>Do not throw an error if the schema does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.</dd>

<dt>\<name\>   </dt>
<dd>The name of the schema to remove.</dd>

<dt>CASCADE  </dt>
<dd>Automatically drops any objects contained in the schema (tables, functions, etc.).</dd>

<dt>RESTRICT  </dt>
<dd>Refuse to drop the schema if it contains any objects. This is the default.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Examples

Remove the schema `mystuff` from the database, along with everything it contains:

``` pre
DROP SCHEMA mystuff CASCADE;
```

## <a id="topic1__section6"></a>Compatibility

`DROP SCHEMA` is fully conforming with the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one schema to be dropped per command. Also, the `IF           EXISTS` option is a HAWQ extension.
