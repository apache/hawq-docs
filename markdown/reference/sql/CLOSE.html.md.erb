Closes a cursor.

## <a id="topic1__section2"></a>Synopsis

``` pre
CLOSE <cursor_name>
         
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

`CLOSE` frees the resources associated with an open cursor. After the cursor is closed, no subsequent operations are allowed on it. A cursor should be closed when it is no longer needed.

Every non-holdable open cursor is implicitly closed when a transaction is terminated by `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`. A holdable cursor is implicitly closed if the transaction that created it aborts via `ROLLBACK`. If the creating transaction successfully commits, the holdable cursor remains open until an explicit `CLOSE` is executed, or the client disconnects.

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Parameters

<dt> \<cursor\_name\>   </dt>
<dd>The name of an open cursor to close.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Notes

HAWQ does not have an explicit `OPEN` cursor statement. A cursor is considered open when it is declared. Use the `DECLARE` statement to declare (and open) a cursor.

You can see all available cursors by querying the `pg_cursors` system view.

## <a id="topic1__section6"></a>Examples

Close the cursor `portala`:

``` pre
CLOSE portala;
```

## <a id="topic1__section7"></a>Compatibility

`CLOSE` is fully conforming with the SQL standard.
