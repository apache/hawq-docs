Removes a sequence.

## <a id="topic1__section2"></a>Synopsis

``` pre
DROP SEQUENCE [IF EXISTS]  <name> [, ...] [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

`DROP SEQUENCE` removes a sequence generator table. You must own the sequence to drop it (or be a superuser).

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Parameters

<dt>IF EXISTS  </dt>
<dd>Do not throw an error if the sequence does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.</dd>

<dt>\<name\>   </dt>
<dd>The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the sequence to remove.</dd>

<dt>CASCADE  </dt>
<dd>Automatically drop objects that depend on the sequence.</dd>

<dt>RESTRICT  </dt>
<dd>Refuse to drop the sequence if any objects depend on it. This is the default.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Examples

Remove the sequence `myserial`:

``` pre
DROP SEQUENCE myserial;
```

## <a id="topic1__section6"></a>Compatibility

`DROP SEQUENCE` is fully conforming with the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one sequence to be dropped per command. Also, the `IF           EXISTS` option is a HAWQ extension.
