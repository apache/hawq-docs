## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

HAWQ does not support `CREATE USER`. This command has been replaced by [CREATE ROLE](CREATE-ROLE.html).

The only difference between `CREATE ROLE` and `CREATE                     USER` is that `LOGIN` is assumed by default with `CREATE USER`, whereas `NOLOGIN` is assumed by default with `CREATE ROLE`.

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Compatibility

There is no `CREATE USER` statement in the SQL standard.
