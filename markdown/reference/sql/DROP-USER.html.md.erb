Removes a database role.

## <a id="topic1__section2"></a>Synopsis

``` pre
DROP USER [IF EXISTS] <name> [, ...]
```

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

`DROP USER` is an obsolete command, though still accepted for backwards compatibility. Groups (and users) have been superseded by the more general concept of roles. See [DROP ROLE](DROP-ROLE.html) for more information.

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Parameters

<dt>IF EXISTS  </dt>
<dd>Do not throw an error if the role does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.</dd>

<dt>\<name\>  </dt>
<dd>The name of an existing role.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Compatibility

There is no `DROP USER` statement in the SQL standard. The SQL standard leaves the definition of users to the implementation.
