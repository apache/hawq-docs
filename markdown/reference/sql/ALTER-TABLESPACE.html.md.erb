## <a id="desc"></a>Description

`ALTER TABLESPACE` changes the definition of a tablespace.

You must own the tablespace to use `ALTER TABLESPACE`. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role. (Note that superusers have these privileges automatically.)

<dt> \<name\>   </dt>
<dd>The name of an existing tablespace.</dd>

<dt> \<newname\>   </dt>
<dd>The new name of the tablespace. The new name cannot begin with *pg\_* (reserved for system tablespaces).</dd>

<dt> \<newowner\>   </dt>
<dd>The new owner of the tablespace.</dd>

## <a id="altertablespace__section5"></a>Examples

Rename tablespace `index_space` to `fast_raid`:

ALTER TABLESPACE index_space RENAME TO fast_raid;

Change the owner of tablespace `index_space`:

ALTER TABLESPACE index_space OWNER TO mary;
