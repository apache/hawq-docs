Shuts down and then restarts a HAWQ system after shutdown is complete.

## <a id="topic1__section2"></a>Synopsis

## <a id="topic1__section3"></a>Description

The `hawq restart` utility is used to shut down and restart the HAWQ server processes. It is essentially equivalent to performing a `hawq stop -M                                         smart` operation followed by `hawq                                         start`.

The \<object\> in the command specifies what entity should be started: e.g. a cluster, a segment, the master node, standby node, or all segments in the cluster.

When the `hawq restart` command runs, the utility uploads changes made to the master `pg_hba.conf` file or to the runtime configuration parameters in the master `hawq-site.xml` file without interruption of service. Note that any active sessions will not pick up the changes until they reconnect to the database.

## Objects

<dt>cluster  </dt>
<dd>Restart a HAWQ cluster.</dd>

<dt>master  </dt>
<dd>Restart HAWQ master.</dd>

<dt>segment  </dt>
<dd>Restart a local segment node.</dd>

<dt>standby  </dt>
<dd>Restart a HAWQ standby.</dd>

<dt>allsegments  </dt>
<dd>Restart all segments.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section4"></a>Options

<dt>-a (do not prompt)  </dt>
<dd>Do not prompt the user for confirmation.</dd>

<dt>-l, -\\\-logdir \<logfile\_directory\>  </dt>
<dd>Specifies the log directory for logs of the management tools. The default is `~/hawq/Adminlogs/`.</dd>

<dt>-q, -\\\-quiet   </dt>
<dd>Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on the screen, but is still written to the log file.</dd>

<dt>-v, -\\\-verbose  </dt>
<dd>Displays detailed status, progress and error messages output by the utility.</dd>

<dt>-t,  -\\\-timeout \<timeout\_seconds\>  </dt>
<dd>Specifies a timeout in seconds to wait for a segment instance to start up. If a segment instance was shutdown abnormally (due to power failure or killing its `postgres` database listener process, for example), it may take longer to start up due to the database recovery and validation process. If not specified, the default timeout is 600 seconds.</dd>

<dt>-M, -\\\-mode smart | fast | immediate  </dt>
<dd>Smart shutdown is the default. Shutdown fails with a warning message, if active connections are found.

Fast shut down interrupts and rolls back any transactions currently in progress .

Immediate shutdown aborts transactions in progress and kills all `postgres` processes without allowing the database server to complete transaction processing or clean up any temporary or in-process work files. Because of this, immediate shutdown is not recommended. In some instances, it can cause database corruption that requires manual recovery.</dd>

<dt>-u, -\\\-reload  </dt>
<dd>Utility mode. This mode runs on the master, only, and only allows incoming sessions that specify gp\_session\_role=utility. It allows bash scripts to reload the parameter values and connect but protects the system from normal clients who might be trying to connect to the system during startup.</dd>

<dt>-R, -\\\-restrict   </dt>
<dd>Starts HAWQ in restricted mode (only database superusers are allowed to connect).</dd>

<dt>-U, -\\\-special-mode maintenance   </dt>
<dd>(Superuser only) Start HAWQ in \[maintenance | upgrade\] mode. In maintenance mode, the `gp_maintenance_conn` parameter is set.</dd>

<dt>-\\\-ignore\-bad\-hosts cluster | allsegments  </dt>
<dd>Overrides copying configuration files to a host on which SSH validation fails. If ssh to a skipped host is reestablished, make sure the configuration files are re-synched once it is reachable.</dd>

<dt>-? , -h , -\\\-help (help)  </dt>
<dd>Displays the online help.</dd>

<dt>-\\\-version (show utility version)  </dt>
<dd>Displays the version of this utility.</dd>

## <a id="topic1__section5"></a>Examples

Restart a HAWQ cluster:

``` shell
$ hawq restart cluster
```

Restart a HAWQ system in restricted mode (only allow superuser connections):

``` shell
$ hawq restart cluster -R
```

Start the HAWQ master instance only and connect in utility mode:

``` shell
$ hawq start master -m PGOPTIONS='-c gp_session_role=utility' psql
```
