The `pg_shdescription` system catalog table stores optional descriptions (comments) for shared database objects. Descriptions can be manipulated with the `COMMENT` command and viewed with `psql`'s `\d` meta-commands. See also [pg\_description](pg_description.html#topic1), which performs a similar function for descriptions involving objects within a single database. Unlike most system catalogs, `pg_shdescription` is shared across all databases of a HAWQ system: there is only one copy of `pg_shdescription` per system, not one per database.
