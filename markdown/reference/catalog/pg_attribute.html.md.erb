The `pg_attribute` table stores information about table columns. There will be exactly one `pg_attribute` row for every column in every table in the database. (There will also be attribute entries for indexes, and all objects that have `pg_class` entries.) The term attribute is equivalent to column.

| `attrelid`      | oid      | pg\_class.oid | The table this column belongs to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `attname`       | name     |               | The column name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `atttypid`      | oid      | pg\_type.oid  | The data type of this column                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `attstattarget` | integer  |               | Controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column by `ANALYZE`. A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A negative value says to use the system default statistics target. The exact meaning of positive values is data type-dependent. For scalar data types, it is both the target number of "most common values" to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create. |
| `attlen`        | smallint |               | A copy of pg\_type.typlen of this column's type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `attnum`        | smallint |               | The number of the column. Ordinary columns are numbered from 1 up. System columns, such as oid, have (arbitrary) negative numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `attndims`      | integer  |               | Number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise `0`. (Presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means it is an array)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `attcacheoff`   | integer  |               | Always `-1` in storage, but when loaded into a row descriptor in memory this may be updated to cache the offset of the attribute within the row                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `atttypmod`     | integer  |               | Records type-specific data supplied at table creation time (for example, the maximum length of a varchar column). It is passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. The value will generally be `-1` for types that do not need it.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `attbyval`      | boolean  |               | A copy of pg\_type.typbyval of this column's type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `attstorage`    | char     |               | Normally a copy of `pg_type.typstorage` of this column's type. For TOAST-able data types, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `attalign`      | char     |               | A copy of `pg_type.typalign` of this column's type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `attnotnull`    | boolean  |               | This represents a not-null constraint. It is possible to change this column to enable or disable the constraint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `atthasdef`     | boolean  |               | This column has a default value, in which case there will be a corresponding entry in the `pg_attrdef` catalog that actually defines the value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `attisdropped`  | boolean  |               | This column has been dropped and is no longer valid. A dropped column is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via SQL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `attislocal`    | boolean  |               | This column is defined locally in the relation. Note that a column may be locally defined and inherited simultaneously                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `attinhcount`   | integer  |               | The number of direct ancestors this column has. A column with a nonzero number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
