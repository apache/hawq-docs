title: gp_configuration_history
---

The `gp_configuration_history` table contains information about system changes related to fault detection and recovery operations. The HAWQ [fault tolerance service](../../admin/FaultTolerance.html) logs data to this table, as do certain related management utilities such as `hawq init`. For example, when you add a new segment to the system, records for these events are logged to `gp_configuration_history`. If a segment is marked as down by the fault tolerance service in the [gp\_segment\_configuration](gp_segment_configuration.html) catalog table, then the reason for being marked as down is recorded in this table.

The event descriptions stored in this table may be helpful for troubleshooting serious system issues in collaboration with HAWQ support technicians.

This table is populated only on the master. This table is defined in the `pg_global` tablespace, meaning it is globally shared across all databases in the system.
