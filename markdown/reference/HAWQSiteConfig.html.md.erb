This section describes all server configuration guc/parameters that are available in HAWQ.

Configuration guc/parameters are located in `$GPHOME/etc/hawq-site.xml`. This configuration file resides on all HAWQ instances and is managed either by Ambari or by using the `hawq config` utility. On HAWQ clusters installed and managed by Ambari, always use the Ambari administration interface, and not `hawq config`, to configure HAWQ properties. Ambari will overwrite any changes made using `hawq config`. 

You can use the same configuration file cluster-wide across both master and segments.

**Note:** While `postgresql.conf` still exists in HAWQ, any parameters defined in `hawq-site.xml` will overwrite configurations in `postgresql.conf`. For this reason, we recommend that you only use `hawq-site.xml` to configure your HAWQ cluster.

**Note:** If you install and manage HAWQ using Ambari, be aware that any property changes to `hawq-site.xml` made using the command line could be overwritten by Ambari. For Ambari-managed HAWQ clusters, always use the Ambari administration interface to set or change HAWQ configuration properties.
