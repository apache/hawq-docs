You can start `gpfdist` in your current directory location or in any directory that you specify. The default port is `8080`.

From your current directory, type:

``` shell
$ gpfdist &
```

From a different directory, specify the directory from which to serve files, and optionally, the HTTP port to run on.

To start `gpfdist` in the background and log output messages and errors to a log file:

``` shell
$ gpfdist -d /var/load_files -p 8081 -l /home/gpadmin/log &
```

For multiple `gpfdist` instances on the same ETL host (see [External Tables Using Multiple gpfdist Instances with Multiple NICs](g-about-gpfdist-setup-and-performance.html#topic14__du165882)), use a different base directory and port for each instance. For example:

``` shell
$ gpfdist -d /var/load_files1 -p 8081 -l /home/gpadmin/log1 &
$ gpfdist -d /var/load_files2 -p 8082 -l /home/gpadmin/log2 &
```

To stop `gpfdist` when it is running in the background:

First find its process id:

``` shell
$ ps -ef | grep gpfdist
```

Then kill the process, for example (where 3456 is the process ID in this example):

``` shell
$ kill 3456
```
