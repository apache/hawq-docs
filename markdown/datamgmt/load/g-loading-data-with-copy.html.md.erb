title: Loading Data with COPY
---

`COPY FROM` copies data from a file or standard input into a table and appends the data to the table contents. `COPY` is non-parallel: data is loaded in a single process using the HAWQ master instance. Using `COPY` is only recommended for very small data files.

The `COPY` source file must be accessible to the master host. Specify the `COPY` source file name relative to the master host location.

HAWQ copies data from `STDIN` or `STDOUT` using the connection between the client and the master server.
