You specify a custom data format in the `FORMAT` clause of `CREATE             EXTERNAL TABLE`.

```
FORMAT 'CUSTOM' (formatter=format_function, key1=val1,...keyn=valn)
```

Where the `'CUSTOM'` keyword indicates that the data has a custom format and `formatter` specifies the function to use to format the data, followed by comma-separated parameters to the formatter function.

HAWQ provides functions for formatting fixed-width data, but you must author the formatter functions for variable-width data. The steps are as follows.

1.  Author and compile input and output functions as a shared library.
2.  Specify the shared library function with `CREATE FUNCTION` in HAWQ.
3.  Use the `formatter` parameter of `CREATE EXTERNAL                TABLE`'s `FORMAT` clause to call the function.
