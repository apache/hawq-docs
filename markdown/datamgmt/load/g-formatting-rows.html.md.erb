HAWQ expects rows of data to be separated by the `LF` character (Line feed, `0x0A`), `CR` (Carriage return, `0x0D`), or `CR` followed by `LF` (`CR+LF`, `0x0D 0x0A`). `LF` is the standard newline representation on UNIX or UNIX-like operating systems. Operating systems such as Windows or Mac OS X use `CR` or `CR+LF`. All of these representations of a newline are supported by HAWQ as a row delimiter.
