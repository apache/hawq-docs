title: Creating and Using Web External Tables
---

`CREATE EXTERNAL WEB TABLE` creates a web table definition. Web external tables allow HAWQ to treat dynamic data sources like regular database tables. Because web table data can change as a query runs, the data is not rescannable.

You can define command-based or URL-based web external tables. The definition forms are distinct: you cannot mix command-based and URL-based definitions.
