Use SQL commands such as `INSERT` and `SELECT` to query a readable external table, the same way that you query a regular database table. For example, to load travel expense data from an external table, `ext_expenses`, into a database table,` expenses_travel`:

``` sql
=# INSERT INTO expenses_travel 
SELECT * FROM ext_expenses WHERE category='travel';
```

To load all data into a new database table:

``` sql
=# CREATE TABLE expenses AS SELECT * FROM ext_expenses;
```
