title: Transforming with GPLOAD
---

To transform data using the `GPLOAD ` control file, you must specify both the file name for the `TRANSFORM_CONFIG` file and the name of the `TRANSFORM` operation in the `INPUT` section of the `GPLOAD` control file.

-   `TRANSFORM_CONFIG `specifies the name of the `gpfdist` configuration file.
-   The `TRANSFORM` setting indicates the name of the transformation that is described in the file named in `TRANSFORM_CONFIG`.

``` pre

VERSION: 1.0.0.1
DATABASE: ops
USER: gpadmin
GPLOAD:
INPUT:
- TRANSFORM_CONFIG: config.yaml
- TRANSFORM: prices_input
- SOURCE:
FILE: prices.xml
```

The transformation operation name must appear in two places: in the `TRANSFORM` setting of the `gpfdist` configuration file and in the `TRANSFORMATIONS` section of the file named in the `TRANSFORM_CONFIG` section.

In the `GPLOAD` control file, the optional parameter `MAX_LINE_LENGTH` specifies the maximum length of a line in the XML transformation data that is passed to hawq load.

The following diagram shows the relationships between the `GPLOAD` control file, the `gpfdist` configuration file, and the XML data file.
