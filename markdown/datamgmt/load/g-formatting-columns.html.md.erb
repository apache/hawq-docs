The default column or field delimiter is the horizontal `TAB` character (`0x09`) for text files and the comma character (`0x2C`) for CSV files. You can declare a single character delimiter using the `DELIMITER` clause of `COPY`, `CREATE                 EXTERNAL TABLE` or the `hawq load` configuration table when you define your data format. The delimiter character must appear between any two data value fields. Do not place a delimiter at the beginning or end of a row. For example, if the pipe character ( | ) is your delimiter:

``` pre
data value 1|data value 2|data value 3
```

The following command shows the use of the pipe character as a column delimiter:

``` sql
=# CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_table (name text, date date)
LOCATION ('gpfdist://host:port/filename.txt)
FORMAT 'TEXT' (DELIMITER '|');
```
