The _Getting Started with HAWQ_ exercises operate on a HAWQ 2.x runtime environment. This environment may be a commerical HAWQ product distribution, a HAWQ sandbox virtual machine or docker environment, or a HAWQ installation you built from source. 

[Running a HAWQ Cluster](../../admin/RunningHAWQ.html) provides an overview of the components comprising a HAWQ cluster, including the users (administrative and operating), deployment systems (HAWQ master, standby, and segments), databases, and data sources.

This section introduces you to the HAWQ runtime environment. You will examine your HAWQ installation, set up your HAWQ environment, and execute HAWQ management commands. If installed in your environment, you will also explore the Ambari management console.

## <a id="tut_runtime_usercred"></a>Prerequisites

The HAWQ administrative user is named `gpadmin`. This is the user account from which you will administer your HAWQ cluster. To perform the exercises in this tutorial, you must:

- Obtain the `gpadmin` user credentials.

- Ensure that your HAWQ runtime environment is configured such that the HAWQ admin user `gpadmin` can run commands to access the HDFS Hadoop system accounts (`hdfs`, `hadoop`) via `sudo` without having to provide a password.

- Obtain the Ambari UI user name and password (optional, if Ambari is installed in your HAWQ deployment).

## <a id="tut_runtime_setup"></a> Exercise: Set Up your HAWQ Runtime Environment

HAWQ installs a script that you can use to set up your HAWQ cluster environment. The `greenplum_path.sh` script, located in your HAWQ root install directory, sets `$PATH` and other environment variables to find HAWQ files.  Most importantly, `greenplum_path.sh` sets the `$GPHOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the HAWQ installation.  If you installed HAWQ from a product distribution or are running a HAWQ sandbox environment, the HAWQ root is typically `/usr/local/hawq`. If you built HAWQ from source or downloaded the tarball, your `$GPHOME` may differ.

Perform the following steps to set up your HAWQ runtime environment:

1. Install a HAWQ commercial product distribution, install a HAWQ sandbox virtual machine or docker environment, or build and install HAWQ from source. Ensure that your HAWQ installation is configured appropriately.

2. Make note of the HAWQ master node hostname or IP address.

4.	Log in to the HAWQ master node using the `gpadmin` user credentials:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<master>
    Password:
    ```

5. Set up your HAWQ operating environment by sourcing the `greenplum_path.sh` file. If you built HAWQ from source or downloaded the tarball, substitute the path to the installed or extracted `greenplum_path.sh` file \(for example `/opt/hawq-2.1.0.0/greenplum_path.sh`\):

    ``` shell
    hawq-node$ source /usr/local/hawq/greenplum_path.sh
    ```
    
    `source`ing `greenplum_path.sh` sets `$GPHOME`. `source`ing `greenplum_path.sh` also sets `PATH` to include the HAWQ `$GPHOME/bin/` directory and sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the HAWQ libraries in `$GPHOME/lib/`.
    
    Note: You must source `greenplum_path.sh` before invoking any HAWQ commands. 

3. Edit your `.bash_profile` or other shell initialization file to source `greenplum_path.sh` on login.  For example, add:

    ``` shell
    source /usr/local/hawq/greenplum_path.sh
    ```
    
4. Set HAWQ-specific environment variables relevant to your deployment in your shell initialization file. These include `PGAPPNAME`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, and `PGUSER.` For example, if you use a custom HAWQ master port number, make this port number the default by setting the `PGPORT` environment variable in your shell initialization file; add:

    ``` shell
    export PGPORT=10432
    ```
    
    Setting `PGPORT` simplifies `psql` invocation by providing a default for the `-p` (port) option.

    You may choose to set additional HAWQ deployment-specific environment variables. See [Environment Variables](../../reference/HAWQEnvironmentVariables.html#optionalenvironmentvariables).

6. Examine your HAWQ installation:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@master$ ls $GPHOME
    bin  docs  etc  greenplum_path.sh  include  lib  sbin  share
    ```
    
    The HAWQ command line utilities are located in `$GPHOME/bin`. `$GPHOME/lib` includes HAWQ and PostgreSQL libraries.

    Refer to [HAWQ Files and Directories](../../admin/setuphawqopenv.html#hawq_env_files_and_dirs) for a list of other HAWQ files and directories and their install locations.
  
6. View the current state of your HAWQ cluster, and if it is not already running, start the cluster. In practice, you will perform different procedures depending upon whether you manage your cluster from the command line or using Ambari.

    *Command line*:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@master$ hawq state
    Failed to connect to database, this script can only be run when the database is up.

    *Ambari*:
    
    1. Start the Ambari management console by entering the following URL in your favorite (supported) browser window:

        ``` shell
        <ambari-server-node>:8080
        ```

    2. Log in with the Ambari credentials and view the Ambari dashboard:

        ![Ambari Dashboard](imgs/ambariconsole.png)
 
        After logging in, the Ambari dashboard displays. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance status of the health of your HAWQ cluster. A list of each running service and it's status is provided in the left panel. The main display area includes a set of configurable tiles providing specific information about your cluster, including HAWQ segment status, HDFS disk usage, and resource manager metrics. 
        
    3. Select the **HAWQ** service from the left pane. If the HAWQ service is not running, select the **Start** operation from the **Service Actions** menu button to start your HAWQ cluster.
