`pgcrypto` is a package extension included in your HAWQ distribution. You must explicitly enable the cryptographic functions to use this extension.

## <a id="pgcryptoprereq"></a>Prerequisites 


Before you enable the `pgcrypto` software package, make sure that your HAWQ database is running, you have sourced `greenplum_path.sh`, and that the `$GPHOME` environment variable is set.

## <a id="enablepgcrypto"></a>Enable pgcrypto 

On every database in which you want to enable `pgcrypto`, run the following command:

``` shell
$ psql -d <dbname> -f $GPHOME/share/postgresql/contrib/pgcrypto.sql
```
	
Replace \<dbname\> with the name of the target database.
	
## <a id="uninstallpgcrypto"></a>Disable pgcrypto 

The `uninstall_pgcrypto.sql` script removes `pgcrypto` objects from your database.  On each database in which you enabled `pgcrypto` support, execute the following:

``` shell
$ psql -d <dbname> -f $GPHOME/share/postgresql/contrib/uninstall_pgcrypto.sql
```

Replace \<dbname\> with the name of the target database.
	
**Note:**  This script does not remove dependent user-created objects.
