## <a id="core_file_definition"></a>Core file

Core file is a disk file that records the image of a process' memory in case the process crashes or terminates abruptly. This image can be later used to debug the state of process at the time when it was terminated. This information can be very useful to debug the cause failure.

## <a id="packcore_definition"></a>Packcore

Packcore utility helps in packing a core file with its context â€“ executable, application and system shared libraries from the current environment. This information can be later unpacked on a different system and can be used for debugging. Packcore takes a core file, extracts the name of the binary which generated the core and executes `ldd` (List Dynamic Dependencies) to get the required information into a single tar archive.

### <a id="using_packcore"></a>Using packcore 

The packcore utility is located under `${GPHOME}/sbin`. Following are the options for packing a core file:

```shell
$GPHOME/sbin/packcore <core_file>

or 

$GPHOME/sbin/packcore -b|--binary  $GPHOME/bin/postgres <core_file>
```

Alternatively, you can navigate to `$GPHOME/sbin` and run the following:

```shell
./packcore <core_file>

or 

./packcore -b|--binary $GPHOME/bin/postgres <core_file>
```
Once finished the utility will create a tar file named `packcore-<core_file>.tgz`. This file can be later unpacked on another system and used for debugging.
