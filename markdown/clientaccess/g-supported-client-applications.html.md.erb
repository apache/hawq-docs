Users can connect to HAWQ using various client applications:

-   A number of [HAWQ Client Applications](g-hawq-database-client-applications.html) are provided with your HAWQ installation. The `psql` client application provides an interactive command-line interface to HAWQ.
-   Using standard ODBC/JDBC Application Interfaces, such as ODBC and JDBC, users can connect their client applications to HAWQ.
