Your HAWQ deployment may have multiple databases. This is different from some database management systems \(such as Oracle\) where the database instance *is* the database. Although you can create many databases in a HAWQ system, client programs can connect to and access only one database at a time â€” you cannot cross-query between databases.

## <a id="topic3"></a>About Template Databases 

Each new database you create is based on a *template*. HAWQ provides a default database, `template1`. HAWQ uses `template1` to create databases unless you specify another template. Do not create any objects in `template1` unless you want those objects to be in every database you create.

HAWQ uses two other database templates internally, `template0` and `postgres`. Do not drop or modify `template0` or `postgres`. You can use `template0` to create a completely clean database containing only the standard objects predefined by HAWQ at initialization. This may be necessary if you have modified `template1`.

## <a id="topic4"></a>Creating a Database 

You must have appropriate privileges or be a HAWQ superuser to create a database. If you do not have the correct privileges, you cannot create a database. The HAWQ administrator must either grant you the necessary privileges or create a database for you.

The [CREATE DATABASE](../reference/sql/CREATE-DATABASE.html) command creates a new database. For example:

``` sql
=# CREATE DATABASE <new_dbname>;
```

You can also use the client program `createdb` to create a database. For example, running the following command connects to HAWQ on the host named `hmaster` at port `5432` and creates a database named `mydatabase`:

``` shell
$ createdb -h hmaster -p 5432 mydatabase
```

The host name and port must match the host name and port of the HAWQ master node.

Some objects, such as roles, are shared by all of the databases in a HAWQ deployment. Other objects, such as tables that you create, are known only to the database in which you create them.

### <a id="topic5"></a>Cloning a Database 

By default, a new database is created by cloning the standard system database template, `template1`. You can identify an alternate template to use for database creation. As mentioned in the section above, you can specify `template0` as the template:

``` sql
=# CREATE DATABASE <new_dbname> WITH TEMPLATE template0;
```

## <a id="topic6"></a>Viewing the List of Databases 

You can use the `\l` meta-command of the `psql` client subsystem to display the list of databases and templates in your HAWQ deployment. If you are a database superuser, you can query the list of databases from the `pg_database` system catalog table. For example:

``` sql
=# SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
```

## <a id="topic7"></a>Altering a Database 

Use the [ALTER DATABASE](../reference/sql/ALTER-DATABASE.html) command to update database attributes including owner or name. You can also use ALTER DATABASE to update a database's default configuration. For example, the following command alters the `search_path` server configuration parameter to change the default schema search path for database `mydatabase`:

``` sql
=# ALTER DATABASE mydatabase SET search_path TO myschema, public, pg_catalog;
```

To alter a database, you must be the owner of the database or a superuser.

## <a id="topic8"></a>Dropping a Database 

The [DROP DATABASE](../reference/sql/DROP-DATABASE.html) command drops \(deletes\) a database. It removes the system catalog entries for the database and deletes the data on disk. You must be the database owner or a superuser to drop a database, and you cannot drop a database while you or anyone else is connected to it. Connect to `template1` \(or another database\) before dropping a database. For example:

``` shell
=# \c template1
```
``` sql
=# DROP DATABASE mydatabase;
```

You can also use the client program `dropdb` to drop a database. For example, the following command connects to HAWQ on the host named `hmaster` at port `5432` and drops the database named `mydatabase`:

``` shell
$ dropdb -h hmaster -p 5432 mydatabase
```

**Warning:** Dropping a database cannot be undone.
