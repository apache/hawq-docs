The configuration parameters for HAWQ are maintained in the `$GPHOME/etc/hawq-site.xml` file. This file resides on all HAWQ instances and can be modified either via Ambari or by using the HAWQ command line interface. Use a consistent strategy (Ambari or command line interface) to maintain the contents of `hawq-site.xml`. 

For Ambari-managed clusters, always use Ambari for configuring `hawq-site.xml` parameters; restarting or reconfiguring HAWQ via Ambari will overwrite any configuration changes to `hawq-site.xml` made outside the Ambari interface.

If you manage your cluster using command line tools instead of Ambari, use a consistent `hawq-site.xml` file to configure your entire cluster. 

**Note:** Do not configure HAWQ parameters through the `postgresql.conf` file. Use only `hawq-site.xml` to configure your HAWQ cluster. Any parameters defined in `hawq-site.xml` will overwrite parameters in `postgresql.conf`.
