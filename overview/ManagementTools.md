# HAWQ Management Tools {#hawqarchitecture}

HAWQ management tools are consolidated into one `hawq` command.

The `hawq` command can init, start and stop each segment separately, and supports dynamic expansion of the cluster.

See [HAWQ Management Tools Reference](../reference/cli/management_tools.md#) for a list of all tools available in HAWQ.
