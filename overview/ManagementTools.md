title: HAWQ Management Tools
---

HAWQ management tools are consolidated into one `hawq` command.

The `hawq` command can init, start and stop each segment separately, and supports dynamic expansion of the cluster.

See [HAWQ Management Tools Reference](/200/hawq/reference/cli/management_tools.html) for a list of all tools available in HAWQ.
