title: Changed Behavior with GPORCA
---

<span class="shortdesc">When GPORCA is enabled, HAWQ's behavior changes. This topic describes these changes.</span>

-   The command `CREATE TABLE AS` distributes table data randomly if the `DISTRIBUTED BY` clause is not specified and no primary or unique keys are specified.
-   Statistics are required on the root table of a partitioned table. The `ANALYZE` command generates statistics on both root and individual partition tables (leaf child tables). See the `ROOTPARTITION` clause for `ANALYZE` command.
-   Additional Result nodes in the query plan:
    -   Query plan `Assert` operator.
    -   Query plan `Partition selector` operator.
    -   Query plan `Split` operator.
-   When running `EXPLAIN`, the query plan generated by GPORCA is different than the plan generated by the legacy query optimizer.
-   HAWQ adds the log file message `Planner produced plan` when GPORCA is enabled and HAWQ falls back to the legacy query optimizer to generate the query plan.
-   HAWQ issues a warning when statistics are missing from one or more table columns. When executing an SQL command with GPORCA, HAWQ issues a warning if the command performance could be improved by collecting statistics on a column or set of columns referenced by the command. The warning is issued on the command line and information is added to the HAWQ log file. For information about collecting statistics on table columns, see the `ANALYZE` command.
